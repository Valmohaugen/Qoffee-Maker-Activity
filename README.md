# Qoffee Maker Activity

Welcome to the Qoffee Maker Activity! This is an activity hosted by the Clemson Quantum Club at Clemson University as an extension event of IBM Quantum's Fall Fest 2024.

## Features
- **Quantum Circuit Fundamentals:** Build and simulate quantum circuits using Qiskit and the Aer Simulator.
- **Real Hardware Execution:** Run your circuits on IBM QPUs via the qBraid platform.
- **Visualization:** Visualize quantum states, measurement outcomes, and circuit diagrams.
- **Noise & Fidelity Exploration:** Observe the effects of hardware noise and decoherence on quantum results.
- **Reproducible Experiments:** All code and results are in a single notebook for easy sharing and reproducibility.

## How to Use This Repository

### Clone the repository
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Valmohaugen/Qoffee-Maker-Activity.git
