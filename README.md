# Qoffee Maker Activity: Quantum Circuits & Simulation

Welcome to the Qoffee Maker Activity repository—a collaborative space for quantum circuit simulation, experimentation, and learning. Inspired by SC-Quantathon-v1-2024, this project is designed to make quantum computing accessible and hands-on for all.

## Features

- Quantum Circuit Fundamentals: Build and simulate quantum circuits using Qiskit and the Aer Simulator.
- Real Hardware Execution: Run your circuits on IBM QPUs via the qBraid platform.
- Visualization: Visualize quantum states, measurement outcomes, and circuit diagrams.
- Noise & Fidelity Exploration: Observe the effects of hardware noise and decoherence on quantum results.
- Reproducible Experiments: All code and results are in a single notebook for easy sharing and reproducibility.
